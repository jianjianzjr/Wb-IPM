#WB-IPM (Warm-basis Iterative Projection Method)

This repository contains MATLAB files for the warm-basis method that bridges
learning and iteration for large-scale linear inverse problems, with a case 
study in Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT). 

The code provides demo scripts for WB-IPM, utilities for building warm bases 
from neural outputs, and routines for error/ablation studies.
